AF3DockingScript.json
=====================

This JSON file is the input configuration for AlphaFold 3 protein-ligand
docking. It specifies the GPCR protein sequence and ligand identity for
the docking run.

IMPORTANT: The .json file contains inline comments (// ...) for
documentation purposes. All comments must be removed before the file
can be executed using the alphafold command, as standard JSON does not
support comments.
